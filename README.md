# Solutions for Scala 99 Problems
Here is the solutions for the [Scala 99 Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).

Some of the solutions are original, and others are provided by the website author and updated by me to run properly at the latest Scala version(2.12.6), for the reason that some built-in functions have been deprecated.

If you have a more elegant solution for the problem, welcome to discuss with me, or you can give feedback to Phil Gold, the website author(<phil_g@pobox.com>).
